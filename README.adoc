== vikoqr - Video-Konferenz QR-Code

Ok, in english it would be vicoqr - video-conference QR-code. 
But since I live in germany, I though the german acronym would be nice.

So, now you should know what it is all about.
This repository contains the whole code for the single page - that's not very much.
Feedback is highly welcome!
